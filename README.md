## About The Project


### Introduction

Our project is called **Livel**. This is an application on **live traveling** which helps people travel online and broadcast the journey on the Internet.

Our team aims to create a mobile application which helps the global tourism industry cope with negative economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Moreover, this application is the solution we have come up with to participate in **Solution Challenge 2021** contest from **Google Developer Student Clubs**.

We want to address **Goal 8** - more specifically, **Target 8.9** -  from the **17 Sustainable Development Goals** of **the United Nations General Assembly**:

- *Goal 8*: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.
- *Target 8.9*: By 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products.

You can get the released version, or .apk files, of this application at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vTHi49cROESE3qXBQavpcfnnCKv4vlAr?usp=sharing) or you can follow the path:

  ```sh
  build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk
  ```
You can only see this path when you clone the repository.

After you have downloaded the .apk file, you should check whether this file is the original one or not by using [Checksum](https://www.howtogeek.com/363735/what-is-a-checksum-and-why-should-you-care/) to compare your checksums with ours. Our checksums file is located at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o77G3AW-q6T6-L511ZFN1XONtv6puDIm?usp=sharing).

Last but not least, we have recorded a video content of our application on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0c1RJR9F-4&t=1s)
