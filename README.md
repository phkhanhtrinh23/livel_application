## About The Project



### Introduction

Our project is called **Livel**. This is an application on *live traveling* which helps people travel online and broadcast the journey on the Internet.

Our team aims to create a mobile application which helps the global tourism industry cope with negative economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is one of the **17 Sustainable Development Goals** of the **United Nations General Assembly**.

Moreover, this application is the solution we have come up with to participate in **Solution Challenge 2021** contest from **Google Developer Student Clubs**.

We want to address **Goal 8** - more specifically, **Target 8.9**.

- *Goal 8*: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.
- *Target 8.9*: By 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products.
