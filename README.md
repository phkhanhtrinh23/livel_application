<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="https://github.com/phkhanhtrinh23/livel_application/blob/main/images/screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot" width=500 height=1000>

Our project is called Livel. This is an application on *live traveling* which helps people travel online and broadcast the journey on the Internet.

Our team aims to create a mobile application which helps the global tourism industry cope with negative economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Moreover, this application is the solution we have come up with to address one of the **17 sustainable development goals** which were set in 2015 by the **United Nations General Assembly** and are intended to be achieved by the year 2030.

### Team Members

Our team consists of 4 members, who are:

- Nguyen Thanh Ngan - Project Manager

- Tran Dang Khoa - UI/UX Designer

- Pham Nhut Huy - Back-end Developer & Leader

- Pham Khanh Trinh - Front-end Developer

### Built With

Our application is built with these frameworks and tools:
* [Flutter: 1.22.6](https://flutter.dev/)
* [Dart: 2.10.5](https://dart.dev/)
* [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
